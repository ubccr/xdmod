### Why does the ingestion process take a long time?

If you are experiencing long ingestion times make sure that you have
tuned MySQL properly.  See
[Optimizing the MySQL Server][optimizing-mysql] for more details.

Here is an example of some server parameters that you can change.  Be
sure to understand any changes you make to your MySQL server
configuration.

```ini
[mysqld]
key_buffer_size = 1G
sort_buffer_size = 16M
read_buffer_size = 4M
join_buffer_size = 32M
innodb_buffer_pool_size = 1G
max_allowed_packet = 1G
tmp_table_size = 1G
max_heap_table_size = 1G
thread_stack = 256K
thread_cache_size = 8
query_cache_limit = 16M
query_cache_size = 1G
group_concat_max_len = 16M
innodb_stats_on_metadata = off
```

### How do I install Open XDMoD in a non-root URL?

Non-root URLs are not supported at this time.

### How do I change the charts on the summary page?

See [HOWTO Change Summary Page Charts](howto-summary-charts.html) for
details.

### How do I add more user names after the initial import?

Just repeat the process found [here](user-names.html) with the new user
names.

### How do I delete all my job data from Open XDMoD?

If you think the job data in your Open XDMoD database is corrupted, you
may want to delete your job data and start over.  To do so, use this
command:

     $ xdmod-admin --truncate --jobs

Running this command will truncate all the tables containing job data
and you can then re-shred and re-ingest your resource manager data.

### Why do I see the error message "It is not safe to rely on the system's timezone settings..."?

You need to set your timezone in your `php.ini` file.  Add the
following, but substitute your timezone:

```ini
date.timezone = America/New_York
```

The PHP website contains the full list of supported [timezones][].

[timezones]: http://php.net/manual/en/timezones.php

### Why do I see "Unknown resource attribute" in my xdmod-shredder output?

This indicates that you are using a resource attribute that Open XDMoD
does not recognize. This isn't a problem and can be safely ignored.

### Why do I see the error message "ERROR 1419 (HY000) at line 290: You do not have the SUPER privilege and binary logging is enabled..."?

You have [binary logging][mysql-binary-log] enabled, but the user you
specified to create the Open XDMoD databases doesn't have the `SUPER`
privilege.  You should either disable binary logging (assuming you don't
need it) or [grant][mysql-grant] the `SUPER` privilege to the user that
will create the databases.  You may also use the less safe
[log_bin_trust_function_creators][] variable.

### Why do I see the error message "Failed to correct job times" during the shredding process?

Resource manager account log records may be missing some job data under certain
circumstances.  It is expected that a job record will have a start time, end
time and wall time.  If one of these is missing it will be calculated using the
other two.  If two or more are missing the error message in question will be
displayed along with the values that were present in the job record.  In
addition to this error message a file will be produced at the end of the
shredding process containing the job record that produced the error along with
additional details.  Look for the log message "Job errors written to ...".

One example of a situation that will produce this error is that some resource
managers record a 0 start time in their accounting logs when a job is canceled
before the job started.  It is also possible that other errors occurred to
produce these values so they are not ignored and this error message is produced.
As of Open XDMoD 7.0 any job with a start or end time equal to 0 will not be
ingested into the data warehouse and will not contribute to the job count or
any other metrics.  Previous versions of Open XDMoD did include these jobs
which resulted in inaccurate results.

### Why do I see the error message "User "Public User" not found" instead of the portal?

This indicates that the data needed by the new ACL system introduced in 7.0.0 is
not present.  This is typically caused by failing to migrate the Open XDMoD
database from 6.6.0 to 7.0.0.  The `xdmod-upgrade` script must be executed
after upgrading the Open XDMoD RPM or source installation.

### Why do I see default value or incorrect value MySQL errors?

These errors include:

- `SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 1364 Field ... doesn't have a default value`
- `SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 1366 Incorrect integer value: ''`

If you see either of these errors, you should check your
[Server SQL Modes][sql-mode].  Open XDMoD does not support any of the strict
Server SQL Modes.  You must set `sql_mode = ''` in your MySQL server
configuration.

[sql-mode]: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/sql-mode.html

### Why do I see the error message "Bad Request Your browser sent a request that this server could not understand." in the browser instead of the portal?

This message is displayed if an HTTPS site is accessed via the HTTP protocol. The template
Apache configuration file in Open XDMoD 9.0 and later enables HTTPS. HTTPS
sites should use the https:// prefix in the web address.

### Error "SSLCertificateFile: file '/etc/pki/tls/certs/localhost.crt' does not exist or is empty" when trying to start the webserver

The template Apache configuration file must be edited to specify the path to
valid SSL certificates. See the [webserver configuration section](configuration.html#apache-configuration)
for details on how to configure the server.

### I seem to be unable to login with the correct username and password?

Starting with Open XDMoD 9.0 SSL must be enabled on your web server. When logging in, if you do not
receive an error and your page refreshes without any personalized information, it may be because you
have not enabled SSL. See the [webserver configuration section](configuration.html#apache-configuration) for details
on enabling SSL.

### Why do I see the warning message "Skipping job with unknown state ..." while shredding Slurm data?

The Open XDMoD Slurm shredder will accept data for jobs in all states, but
ignore jobs that have not ended.  If an unknown job state is encountered this
warning message will be generated.  Please notify the Open XDMoD developers
about the unknown state using the [support](support.html) contact information.
