Some test require a valid user account on XDMoD. The username and password
are read from a file called testing.json in this directory.
This file has hard coded user names and passwords that are get created as part
of the CI build process.

## Building From A Base Image

To speed up testing we can create a base image which includes centos with updates, composer, and
phantomjs and then build our XDMoD image on top of that.

```bash
docker build -t centos7:xdmod-base -f Dockerfile.centos7:xdmod-base .
```

## Cache and Config Files
We use some default configuration and cache files to set some defaults for
development and speed up the build times of Docker.
If you look in `assets/copy-caches.sh` you will see all of the files that will be put into place.

### vimrc
This is just some defaults for VIM when useing the docker for development

### npmrc
This is a default used for installing the chromedriver instead of downloading it
as part of an npm install when using the UI tests.  It also turns off the npm
progress bar

### browser-tests-node-modules.tar.gz
the node_modules folder for the UI tests

### saml-idp.tar.gz
the node_modules for the saml-idp server used for testing

### mysql-server.cnf
defaults for mysql server

### composer-cache.tar.gz
The composer cache to speed up the install of composer modules.

### chromedriver_linux64.zip
chromedriver for automated tests.  Since google now versions with chrome the
chromedriver node module doesnt currently handle the installed version.
This also prevents the need to download it everytime.

### PhantomJS
Since PhantomJS is no longer maintained, we have a copy that we use instead of
automatically getting it from the internet everytime
https://bitbucket.org/ariya/phantomjs/downloads/phantomjs-2.1.1-linux-x86_64.tar.bz2
