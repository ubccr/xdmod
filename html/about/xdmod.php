<br><b><font size="5">XDMoD:  Comprehensive HPC System Management Tool</font></b>
</div>

<p>The University at Buffalo Center for Computational Research (CCR) has been at the forefront of the development of open source tools for use by national and campus level high performance computing (HPC) centers to help ensure their optimal operation as well as provide metrics to demonstrate the utility, service, competitive advantage, and return on investment that these centers provide. </p>
<p>The XDMoD (XD Metrics on Demand) tool provides HPC center personnel and senior leadership with the ability to easily obtain detailed operational metrics of HPC systems coupled with extensive analytical capability to optimize performance at the system and job level, ensure quality of service, and provide accurate data to guide system upgrades and acquisitions.</p>

<p>Funded by the National Science Foundation, XDMoD (<a href="https://xdmod.ccr.buffalo.edu" target="_blank">https://xdmod.ccr.buffalo.edu/</a>) is designed to audit and facilitate the operation and utilization of XSEDE, the most advanced and robust collection of integrated advanced digital resources and services in the world.  Similarly, Open XDMoD (<a href="http://open.xdmod.org" target="_blank">http://open.xdmod.org</a>), the open source version of XDMoD, is designed to provide similar capability to academic and industrial HPC centers.</p>
