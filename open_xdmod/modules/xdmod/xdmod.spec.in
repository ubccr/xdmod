* Tue Oct 30 2018 Steven M. Gallo <smgallo@buffalo.edu> 8.0.0-1.0
- Features
    - General
        - Added a **beta** version of the Cloud realm to provide metrics relevant to cloud computing resources.
        - Added a **beta** version of the Storage realm to provide metrics relevant to storage systems installed at a center.
        - Federated XDMoD has been released for production. Federated XDMoD allows individual, locally managed, XDMoD instances to report all or a subset of their accounting data to a central Hub which provides a global view of the federation.
        - All XDMoD user profiles are now associated with an organization. Previously, this was only required for Campus Champions.
        - Added support for automatically detecting / assigning a new SSO User's organization.
        - Added support for automatically detecting if a user's organization has changed and updating their accounts accordingly. This may include, but is not limited to, the removal of elevated privileges.
        - Hardened the login and password reset process as a result of a security audit by University of Cambridge.
        - Improved support for resource manager job arrays.
