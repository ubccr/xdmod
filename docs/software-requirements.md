Linux Distribution Packages
---------------------------

Open XDMoD can be run on any Linux distribution, but has been tested on
CentOS 7.

Most of the requirements can be installed with the package managers
available from these distributions.

### CentOS 7

**NOTE**: The package list below includes packages included with
[EPEL](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL).  This repository can be
added with this command for CentOS 7:

    # yum install epel-release

    # yum install httpd php php-cli php-mysql php-gd \
                  gmp-devel php-gmp php-pdo php-xml \
                  php-pear-MDB2 php-pear-MDB2-Driver-mysql \
                  java-1.8.0-openjdk java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel \
                  mariadb-server mariadb cronie logrotate \
                  ghostscript php-mbstring php-pecl-apcu jq \
                  chromium-headless librsvg2-tools

**NOTE**: After installing Apache and MySQL you must make sure that they
are running.  CentOS may not start these services and they will not
start after a reboot unless you have configured them to do so.

**NOTE**: APCu is optional, but highly recommended as it provides enhanced performance.

Additional Notes
----------------

### PHP

Open XDMoD is tested to work with PHP 5.4.16 and may be compatible with more
recent releases of PHP 5.  Open XDMoD is not compatible with PHP 7 at this
time.

Some Linux distributions (including CentOS) do not set the timezone used
by PHP in their default configuration.  This will result in many warning
messages from PHP.  You should set the timezone in your `php.ini` file
by adding the following, but substituting your timezone:

```ini
date.timezone = America/New_York
```

The PHP website contains the full list of supported [timezones][].

Production Open XDMoD instances should use HTTPS, which is enabled via the webserver
configuration (see below).

[timezones]: https://secure.php.net/manual/en/timezones.php

### Apache

Production instances of Open XDMoD should use HTTPS. This requires
the `mod_ssl` module be installed and enabled. The `mod_headers` module
is also recommended so that the [HTTP Strict-Transport-Security](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security)
header can be set on the webserver.

Open XDMoD requires that mod_rewrite be installed and enabled.  Since
the Open XDMoD portal is a web application you will also need to make
sure you have configured your firewall properly to allow appropriate
network access.

### MySQL

MySQL 5.5.3+ is currently required for use with Open XDMoD.

Open XDMoD is tested to work with MariaDB 5.5.60 and may be compatible with
more recent releases of MySQL and MariaDB.  Open XDMoD is currently not
compatible with MySQL 8.0 at this time.

Refer to the [Configuration Guide](configuration.html#mysql-configuration)
for configuration details.

### Chromium

Chromium is required for graph exporting.

Open XDMoD has been tested with `chromium-headless` from EPEL, `chromium` from EPEL was shown to be usable, but is not actively tested.

### SELinux

Open XDMoD does not work with the default CentOS
SELinux security policy.  You will need to disable SELinux.
