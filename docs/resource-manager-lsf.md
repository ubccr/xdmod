title: LSF Notes
---

Open XDMoD has had support for LSF since version 4.5.0.

Log Files
---------

The LSF shredder included with Open XDMoD is designed to use the
`lsb.acct` file generated by LSF.  If the fields in this file do not
match those expected by Open XDMoD then the shredding process will fail
or incorrect data will be imported.

PI Data Source
--------------

Open XDMoD uses the `projectName` field from `lsb.acct` as the default
PI data source.
