Support Lifecycle
-----------------

In general, Open XDMoD has one or two major releases each year, and each major version will receive support
 for one year from the time of initial release.  This includes security fixes and other critical updates in
addition to limited access to our support team.

Note that the 10.5 release has a longer than typical support window due to a later than typical release date
for 11.0.

| Version | Release Date       | End of Support    |
|---------|--------------------|-------------------|
| 11.0    | October 23, 2024   | October 23, 2025  |
| 10.5    | September 03, 2023 | March 31, 2025*   |

**\* Note: CentOS 7 officially reached end of life on June 30, 2024, and as such so did our official support for el7 XDMoD.**

Rocky 8 is the officially supported operating system for Open XDMoD.  If you
