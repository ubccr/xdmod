title: GPU Metrics
---

Open XDMoD includes support for GPU metrics in the jobs realm starting with
version 9.0.0.  Specifically, the number of GPUs used by each job is tracked and
used to calculate the number of GPU hours and to allow grouping by the number of
GPUs.  Depending on the resource manager, this is either the number of GPUs
allocated to the job or the number of GPUs the job requested.

Only Slurm, PBS, Grid Engine and LSF are supported at this time.

**Please note that if your resource manager is not supported or GPU data is not
available/parsable, that Open XDMoD will report zero GPU hours and a GPU count
of zero.**

## Slurm

The GPU count source for Slurm data is the [`AllocTRES` accounting field taken
from `sacct` output][slurm-sacct-alloctres].  This field contains the
[Trackable Resources][slurm-tres] allocated to the job.  The specific resource
that is used to determine the GPU count is the [Generic Resource][slurm-gres]
identified by `gres/gpu`.

For example:

```
billing=10,cpu=10,gres/gpu=4,mem=374000M,node=2
```

This `AllocTRES` value would indicate that the job was allocated 4 GPUs.

## PBS

The GPU count source for PBS data is the `Resource_List.nodes` field in the
accounting log files.  If a value is specified for `gpus` then that is used as
the number of GPUs per node.

For example:

```
Resource_List.nodes=2:ppn=32:gpus=2
```

This would indicate that the job used 4 GPUs (2 GPUs per node * 2 nodes).

Other versions of PBS use `Resource_List.ngpus`:

```
Resource_List.ngpus=4
```

This would indicate that the job used 4 GPUs.

### Non-Standard PBS GPU data

In addition to the standard way of logging GPUs, two non-standard ways of
logging this data are also supported.  If the GPU count cannot be determined
from `Resource_List.nodes` then these will be used when present.

If the `Resource_List.nodect` field specifies a value for `gpus` then that will
be used.

For example:

```
Resource_List.nodect=2:ppn=32:gpu=2
```

This would indicate that the job used 4 GPUs (2 GPUs per node * 2 nodes).

If neither of those methods produce a value, then `Resource_List.gpu` may be
used to determine the number of GPUs.

For example:

```
Resource_List.gpu=2
```

This would indicate that the job used 2 GPUs.

## Grid Engine (UGE)

Univa Grid Engine is the only Grid Engine based product that is confirmed to
report GPU count data.  If your Grid Engine based product reports GPU data in
the same format then it will be interpreted in the same was as described here.

Please report any issues to the email address on our [support page](support.md).

The GPU count source for UGE is the `category` field in the accounting log
files.  If a value is specified for `gpu` then that is used as the total number
of GPUs for the job.

For example:

```
-l gpu=1
```

This would indicate that the job used 1 GPU.

Grid Engine accounting logs contain one line per node.  If conflicting GPU
counts are found in the data for a job then the greatest value will be used for
the GPU count.

## LSF

The GPU count source for LSF data is the effective resource requirement recorded
in `lsb.acct`.  This is the resource requirement string the user supplied
expanded with the queue and application defaults, including any options given to
`bsub -gpu`.  The specific resource that is used to determine the GPU count is
`ngpus_physical` in the `rusage` section.

For example:

```
select[((ngpus>0)) && (type == local)] order[r15s:pg] rusage[mem=6000.00,ngpus_physical=2.00] span[hosts=1]
```

This would indicate that the job requested 2 GPUs.

The number may be followed by a reservation method.  `/host` means the number of
GPUs on each host, so it is multiplied by the number of hosts the job ran on.
For example, `rusage[ngpus_physical=2/host]` on a job that ran on 3 hosts would
indicate 6 GPUs.  `/job` means the total for the job.

`/task` means the number of GPUs for each task, but LSF accounting logs do not
record how many tasks a job ran, so the number is used as the total for the job.

When no reservation method is given, the number is used as the total for the
job.  LSF documents the `bsub -gpu num=` option as per host by default, so a job
that spans more than one host without `/host` may be undercounted.

The GPU resource names used by older versions of LSF (`ngpus_shared`,
`ngpus_excl_p` and `ngpus_excl_t`) are not supported.
