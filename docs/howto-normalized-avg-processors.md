The "Job Size: Normalized" statistic in the Jobs realm was removed from the default list of statistics in version 11.5.0 of Open XDMoD because the values of the statistic were incorrect if the resource size changed during the time period of the dataset. The values of the statistic were also not physically meaningful except when grouping or filtering by a single resource.

The recommended way to report on this type of statistic in Open XDMoD 11.5+ is to use the [Data Analytics Framework](data-analytics-framework.md) to fetch data from your Open XDMoD portal and compute the normalization factor. However, the "Job Size: Normalized" statistic can also be restored to your Open XDMoD portal by making the following changes to configuration files in your installation of Open XDMoD.

1. Add the following statistic to `datawarehouse.d/ref/Jobs-statistics.json`:
    ```json
    "normalized_avg_processors": {
        "aggregate_formula": {
            "$include": "datawarehouse.d/include/Jobs-norm-avg-proc-agg.sql"
        },
        "description_html": "The percentage average size ${ORGANIZATION_NAME} job divided by the total number of cores in the resource where the job ran. The job normalization calculation assumes that the resource size is constant. This statistic should not be used with a time range where the resource size changes, because the statistic will be incorrect.<br><i>Normalized Job Size: </i>The ratio of the total number of processor cores used by a (parallel) job over the total number of cores on the resource.",
        "name": "Job Size: Normalized",
        "precision": 1,
        "timeseries_formula": {
            "$include": "datawarehouse.d/include/Jobs-norm-avg-proc-time.sql"
        },
        "unit": "% of Total Cores"
    }
    ```
2. Add the following statistic to `datawarehouse.d/ref/Gateways-statistics.json`:
    ```json
    "normalized_avg_processors": {
        "$overwrite": {
            "description_html": "The percentage average size ${ORGANIZATION_NAME} ${REALM_NAME} job over total machine cores.<br><i>Normalized Job Size: </i>The percentage total number of processor cores used by a (parallel) job over the total number of cores on the machine.",
            "name": "Job Size: Normalized via ${REALM_NAME}"
        },
        "$ref-with-overwrite": "datawarehouse.d/ref/Jobs-statistics.json#/normalized_avg_processors"
    }
    ```
3. Create the file `datawarehouse.d/include/Jobs-norm-avg-proc-time.sql`:
    ```sql
    100.0 *
    COALESCE(
        SUM(agg.processor_count * agg.running_job_count)
        /
        SUM(agg.running_job_count)
        /
        (
            SELECT
                SUM(rrf.cpu_processor_count)
            FROM
                modw.resourcespecs rrf
            WHERE
                FIND_IN_SET(
                    rrf.resource_id,
                    GROUP_CONCAT(distinct agg.task_resource_id)
                ) <> 0
                AND ${AGGREGATION_UNIT}_end_ts >= rrf.start_date_ts
                AND (
                    rrf.end_date_ts IS NULL
                    OR ${AGGREGATION_UNIT}_end_ts <= rrf.end_date_ts
                )
        ),
    0)
    ```
4. Create the file `datawarehouse.d/include/Jobs-norm-avg-proc-agg.sql`:
    ```sql
    100.0 *
    COALESCE(
        SUM(agg.processor_count * CASE ${DATE_TABLE_ID_FIELD} WHEN ${MIN_DATE_ID} THEN agg.running_job_count ELSE agg.started_job_count END)
        /
        SUM(CASE ${DATE_TABLE_ID_FIELD} WHEN ${MIN_DATE_ID} THEN agg.running_job_count ELSE agg.started_job_count END)
        /
        (
            SELECT
                SUM(rrf.cpu_processor_count)
            FROM
                modw.resourcespecs rrf
            WHERE
                FIND_IN_SET(
                    rrf.resource_id,
                    GROUP_CONCAT(distinct agg.task_resource_id)
                ) <> 0
                AND ${AGGREGATION_UNIT}_end_ts >= rrf.start_date_ts
                AND (
                    rrf.end_date_ts IS NULL
                    OR ${AGGREGATION_UNIT}_end_ts <= rrf.end_date_ts
                )
        ),
    0)
    ```
