/**
 * Class DBObject
 *
 * The intent of this class is to provide an easy way for child classes, which
 * are meant to represent the data contained within one row of a table,
 * an easy way of interacting with a PDO result set in which the rows have been
 * returned as arrays. In particular, this allows the knowledge of what is
 * expected / contained in these tables / classes to be defined at particular
 * point in time (i.e. git commit ) as opposed to spread throughout the code
 * utilizing these objects. It also allows the utilizing code to interact with
 * the class and its associated properties / functions as opposed to a simple
 * array.
 *
 * On a more technical note, it provides dynamic 'getter' and 'setter'
 * support for calls that follow the form 'getCamelCasePropertyName()' and
 * 'setCamelCasePropertyName($propertyName)' the property name is assumed to be
 * in the form: lcfirst(CamelCase(column_name)) => columnName.
 *
 * And for those who enjoy working with their classes in an array type manner.
 * ArrayAccess has been implemented such that 'offsetGet' corresponds to
 * 'getCamelCasePropertyName()', 'offsetSet' corresponds to
 * 'setCamelCasePropertyName($propertyName)' and 'offsetExists($offset)'
 * ensures that the '$offset' is defined in the $PROP_MAP and that there
 * is a property currently defined with a name that that matches '$offset';
