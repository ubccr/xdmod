/**
 * PHP stream filter implementation allowing data to be passed through an external process

 * standard input and writing to standard output.
 *
 * Stream filters are added to a file handle and intercept data that is read from the file
 * (using standard file functions such as fread()). Filters process the data and pass it
 * along to the next filter and eventually to the application that requested the
 * data. This is transparent to the application that is operating on the file
 * handle. Stream filters must extend the php_user_filter class.
