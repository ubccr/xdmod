/**
 * The ETL process supports populating multiple destinations from a single source. For example,
 * a single database query or data file can be used to populate multiple destination tables.
 * The destination field map is used to map individual fields in the source record fields to fields
 * in the destination (tables).  By default, the destination map supports simple scalar values for
 * the source record field names (i.e., values in the source fields are mapped directly to
 * destination fields).
 *
 * By implementing this interface a data endpoint indicates that it supports complex data records
 * and implements the methods necessary to handle complex source fields in addition to scalar fields
 * in the destination field map. For example, a JSON data endpoint supports complex nested objects
 * and may allow JSON pointers in the map's source fields to reference data inside the complex
 * object.
 *
 * NOTE: Some classes, such as DirectoryScanner, may delegate their support for complex source
 *   records to underlying classes or handlers. To support this we use
 *   iStructuredFile::supportsComplexDataRecords().
 *
 * For example, the following destination map contains JSON pointers to access the nested object in
 * the JSON record below. Without JSON pointers, there would be no way to programmatically access
 * data other than the top level keys.
 *
 * "destination_field_map": {
 *     "instance_types": {
 *         "id": "instance_id",
 *         "name": "/instance_type/name",
 *         "num_cores": "/instace_type/cpu"
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * {
 *     "id": "887233-bya",
 *     "instance_type": {
 *         "name": "m1.medium",
 *         "num_cores": 8,
 *         "memory": 4096
 *     }
 * }
