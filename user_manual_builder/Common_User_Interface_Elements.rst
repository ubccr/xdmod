   Duration Selection Toolbar

The duration selection toolbar (:numref:`durationtoolbar`) is used for selecting
the range of data displayed in a particular data set or chart. It
consists of a drop down list containing commonly accessed time frames,
as well as a pair of date choosers for configuring the user defined time
frames start and end dates, followed by a refresh button for reloading
the data and in turn refreshing the screen.

Chart Configuration Toolbar
-------------------------------

.. figure:: media/image53.png
   :name: chart_config_toolbar

   Chart Configuration Toolbar

The chart configuration toolbar (:numref:`chart_config_toolbar`) provides options for a
user to customize the appearance of individual charts (and their
datasheet view), export the data in a number of output formats, and make
a chart available to the :ref:`Report Generator <report_generator>`

.. figure:: media/image127.png
   :name: dataset_filter

   Dataset Filter

When the user clicks on the filter button, the chart configuration
toolbar is presented with a multi-selector that provides a list of
available data sets to the left and a set of selected data sets to the
right, for example, :numref:`dataset_filter` which displays the filter by resource
multi-selector. The user can then select the desired filter choices by
clicking on the check boxes. The search box and the paging mechanisms
shown in :numref:`dataset_filter` are available to assist the user in sorting
through filters having large numbers of choices. Note that for the Usage
tab that the user must drill down first before the filter becomes
active. The manual sections on the Usage tab and the Metric Explorer
give more details on the use of the filters.

Selection of a node in the tree can be accomplished by left-clicking the
node. A triangular icon to the left of the tree node will point to the
right when the node is collapsed and will point to the bottom right and
have a black fill when expanded. Double clicking a node will select and
expand it. Selected tree nodes are indicated by a light blue background.

nodes in the tree.

Collapse Selector Tree Button |image17|: This will collapse the Usage
tab Chart Selection Tree to the left so that it is only visible as a
thin vertical bar to the left of the screen providing more screen area
for the display of the selected chart or data sheet. Clicking on the
button will show the Selector Tree again.

Chart Viewer
----------------

.. fig 10

.. figure:: media/image28.png
   :name: chart_viewer

   Chart Viewer

The chart viewer is shown in :numref:`chart_viewer` and provides an area where
the user can view and customize metric data as well as export the data
or make the chart available for inclusion in a custom report. At the top
of the Chart Viewer is a trail of breadcrumbs that shows the origin of
the chart. The chart shown in :numref:`chart_viewer` is from the
:only:`<XSEDE>ACCESS` view of the *Usage* tab. The *Jobs by
Resource* category is expanded, followed by selection of the *XD SUs
Charged: Per Job* metric.

Drilldowns: Most of the charts displayed in XDMoD have a drill-down
capability, which will allow users to click on a data series (bar, line,
pie slice, etc.) and acquire more detailed information about the
relevant selection. This is accomplished by hovering the mouse over a
particular data series in a chart and clicking on it, causing a new
drilldown node to be displayed in the Chart Selection Tree and the new
chart to be displayed. When drilldowns are available, the cursor will
change from an arrow to a hand. Whenever a drilldown is not possible the
user will be notified via a tooltip.

   Example of when dilldown is available vs when drilldown is not available

For example, if the second horizontal bar in :numref:`drilldown_example` is clicked
on (NICS KRAKEN), followed by the selection of *Field of Science* from
the menu that appears, the chart shown in :numref:`drilldown_chart_example` will appear.
This new chart will take into account all fields of science which have
contributed to charging XD SUs to resource NICS KRAKEN (respective of
the timeframe selected). Note that the breadcrumb trail reflects the
origin of the chart.

is selected, from left to right, this toolbar consists of the following
buttons:

-  Restoring the thumbnails to their original dimensions

-  Reducing the chart size
