      Summary Tab

The Summary tab (:only:`<XSEDE>{xsede_summary_tab}`:only:`<Open>{open_summary_tab}`) consists of a duration selector
toolbar, a summary information bar, followed by a select set of charts
representative of the usage. The refresh button can be used to reload
the page.

The Summary tab provides a dashboard that presents summary statistics
and selected charts that are useful to the role of the current user.
Pertinent information such as the number of jobs run, average CPU time
per job, and the average number of processors per job are displayed as
well as selected charts that provide an overview of selected available
data. :only:`<XSEDE>For ACCESS this includes the operation of ACCESS as a
whole, a particular Resource Provider, or the state of jobs run by the
current user.` :only:`<Open>For Open XDMoD users this includes
information on the system as a whole, on various sub-clusters and
information specific to the current user.`

To access a more detailed and configurable version of each chart in the
Summary tab, click on the gear icon to the right of the chart title (see
:numref:`summary_portlet_tools` below).

Consult the Quick Filters drop-down menu in the upper-left corner to see
summary content tailored to specific roles (:numref:`summary_portlet_tools`).
