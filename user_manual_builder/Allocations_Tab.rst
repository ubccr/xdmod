expired allocations. Toggle the |active| button or the |expired|
button to view only allocations that are active or expired.
The default view shows a summary for the logged-in individual.
Use the search feature shown in (:numref:`search`) to look up
allocations for other individuals.

   View a summary of your allocations.

The summary view provides basic information about each allocation
including title, charge number, project timeframe, and SU balance.
Allocation information in ACCESS XDMoD is updated daily and therefore does
not have information from the current day. For the most up-to-date information
about an allocation, log in to the `ACCESS Allocations`_ page.
