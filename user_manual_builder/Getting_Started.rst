      ACCESS XDMoD Login

   You must have an ACCESS account to be able to log in to XDMoD.

.. only:: Open

   Open XDMoD supports two different authentication mechanisms: local login
   and Single Sign On. The particular mechanism is configured by the Open
   XDMoD site administrator. To access the login panel click the “Sign In”
   link on the top right of the Open XDMoD public page. An example of a
   login panel for an Open XDMoD instance that authenticates with Single
   Sign On is shown in :numref:`open_login_1`. The specific text and graphics will
   be different for different authentication providers. An example of the
   login panel for an Open XDMoD instance configured to use local login is
   shown in :numref:`open_login_2`.

      Example Login dialog for an Open XDMoD instance
      configured to use Single Sign On. This example shows an Open XDMoD
      instance configured to use the authentication provider at the University
      at Buffalo. Clicking the button with the UB logo opens the official UB
      login page where users can use their university-wide login credentials
      to authenticate.
